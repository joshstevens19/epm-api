Remember it is a NOSQL table so no relational, data has to be structured to be fast and easy.
I would rather have repeated data in it rather then doing 2 lookups, we take the hit on the update of the data
which will have to perform to queries but we know gets will be used more then puts. 

Users Table

- EmailAddress - PK - string - not null
- Password - string - think about encrypting this later - not null
- FirstName - string - not null
- LastName - string - not null
- Introduction - string
- ..... think of more
